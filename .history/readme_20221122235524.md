# CRUD PssP Enhancements

Further enhancements to the 'Patient Self Service Portal' with customization of the landing, login, registration, and account pages. 

Changes Include:
- Customized landing page that includes new logo
- customized login and registration pages matching the landing page design
- New user: 'Provider' with own registration page and patient editing capabilities

## Important Notes
1. Make sure base code is down first
2. Then can adjust css files for visualizations
3. Finally can focus on proper app routing

*This version of the PssP utilizes a different SQL Database layout (i.e. different tables) than the reference design. Both sets of tables, however, have been setup in MySql for testing purposes.*
